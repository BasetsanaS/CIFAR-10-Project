# CIFAR-10-Project
# Project Title:
# BCG Data Science Job Simulation - Customer Churn Analysis

### Overview:
This project is a simulation conducted for XYZ Analytics as part of the BCG Data Science Job Simulation in February 2025. The goal was to analyze customer churn, identify key drivers, and outline a strategic investigation approach to minimize churn in the SME division.

### Project Objectives:
- Perform data analysis to understand customer behavior and churn patterns.

- Build and optimize a predictive model using a Random Forest algorithm.

- Identify key drivers of customer churn and recommend strategic solutions.

### Tools and Technologies:
- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

- Algorithms: Random Forest Classifier

### Approach:
### Data Analysis:

- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and insights.

- Visualized data using Matplotlib and Seaborn for intuitive analysis.

Model Development:

- Engineered and optimized a Random Forest model.

- Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting customer churn.

### Key Findings:

- Churn rate: 9.7% across 14,606 customers.

- The primary churn drivers are yearly consumption, forecasted consumption, and net margin.

- Customer price sensitivity is not a significant churn driver.

- A 20% discount strategy is effective if targeted at high-value customers with high churn probability.

### Recommendations:

- Implement targeted discount strategies based on churn predictions.

- Focus on customers with high yearly consumption and net margin.
